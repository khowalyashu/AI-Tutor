Pass Task 1.1: Reinforcement Learning Environments 
 
Overview 
During week 1, you have learnt about Machine Learning, AI and Reinforcement Learning. 
You have also been briefed about some basic reinforcement learning terminology along with 
examples of learning environments. 
In this task you, will conduct a case study about one of the gym environments from here: 
https://gymnasium.farama.org/ . Navigate to the ‘Environments’ section on the left side (see 
screenshot below), and pick any 1 environment within any of the categories (Classic Control, 
Box2D etc.,).  
 
To complete this assignment, you may refer to the lecture material from Week 1.  
Submission Details 
Submit a report (via OnTrack) discussing the following aspects for any chosen gym 
environment:  
• Describe the states, actions, transition functions and rewards for it.  
• Is it a discrete or continuous state environment? Justify. 
• Is it a discrete or continuous action environment? Justify. 
• Is the transition function deterministic or probabilistic? Why? 
• What would the optimal policy look like? Describe how the reward function enables 
the learning of such an optimal policy.  
Constraints 
The submitted report should not exceed 600 words in length. Please make sure the report 
is well-organised, and maintains a high quality of writing with appropriate references 
included if required.
