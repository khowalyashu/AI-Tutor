Introduction to Multi-Objective 
Reinforcement Learning
Agent takes actions in its environment
Can all problems be expressed in the 
form of rewards?
RL so far:
Maximise sum of rewards  
Sutton’s Reward Hypothesis: 
“All of 
what we mean by goals and purposes can 
be well thought of as maximization of the 
expected value of the cumulative sum of a 
received scalar signal (reward).”
But how to compress all objectives into such a 
scalar reward? – Not easy! 
Are rewards enough?
A more pragmatic approach: we often care about multiple objectives, which need to be 
optimised together  
Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning
How to deal with multiple objectives?
One reward function for each objective
Multiobjective RL
But how deal with these? 
𝑟1,
 
𝑟2
Combine them into a scalar value:
𝑟= 𝑤1𝑟1 + 𝑤2𝑟2
𝑤 specifies the preferences
Single objective: only 1 solution
MultiObjective: multiple solutions (even with 2 objectives)
Multiobjective RL
𝑂𝑏𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 2
𝑂𝑏𝑗𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 1
In general, n_objectives>2
Optimal Solutions (Pareto front): non-dominated policies
-same performance in terms of the scalarised rewards
At the end, we care about agent behaviours
Semi-blind process  
Specifying Preferences
Pick a w, check if any of the solutions correspond to the desired behaviour
If not, pick a different w
Undue burden on engineers/designers
The solutions are not explainable
Problems with Scalarisation
Linear model cannot encompass complex preferences we may have
Preferences change over time
Power production application – 
for double the power, cannot just double 𝑤𝑝 
𝑟= 𝑤𝑝𝑟𝑝+ 𝑤𝑐𝑟𝑐
MORL Examples
Wind farms: maximise power, minimise wear
Other non-linear factors
Transport: minimise travel time, also minimise cost
Can prepare yourself 
with a set of policies 
– useful when trains 
are cancelled etc.,

MultiObjective MDP
MOMDP
In MOMDPS, the value function is a vector 
MOMDP: Utility Function
Utility functions scalarise the multiobjective value vector to a scalar
The optimal policy is not clearly defined unless we know how the objectives are prioritised
However, scalarisation has its own problems, as discussed earlier

MORL: Taxonomy
Single                                             vs                                 Multiple policies
MORL: Taxonomy
Single policy- If utility is known at the 
time of planning
Multiple policies- If utility is unknown
Linear utility                                             vs                                 Non-linear Utility policies
User preferences may not be 
adequately expressed
May better express user preferences
Deterministic policies  
 
vs                                 Stochastic policies
When utility is linear, the optimal policy 
is deterministic and stationary
In some cases, stochastic policies should 
never be permitted
Scalarised Expected Returns (SER)
MORL: Optimisation Criteria
Expected Scalarised Returns (ESR)
These lead to different solutions when 
the utility is non-linear
MORL: Metrics
Hypervolume
Dominated
Part of non-dominated set
Larger the hypervolume the better
MORL: Metrics
When the hypervolume is similar, choose the solution that is most spread out in the space
